Stuff in the Data directory
1. patterns
   * Within the Data directory is another directory called patterns. This contains image files for the ALVAR markers (which you can print) and xml files that tell ALVAR what the pattern looks like. Nothing need be done to this folder. The names look like MarkerData_10_X.pnd where X is the ALVAR id.
   * Transf_Cam_Marker4 - has the old transforms calculated for the cameras.
   * Camera calibration files - in the top level of Data are the calibration files named camCalib_X.xml where X is the camera index 0 to 3 (currently). These are generated by the cameraCalibration program (see helpers.md).
