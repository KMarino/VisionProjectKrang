Finally testSimulation.cpp
I don't actually know any of this code (you'll have to ask Ana), but I understand how to use it. 
1. First, you start the cameraProcess for each camera and the cameraMainProcess to get the ach perception channel. 
2. Then you call ./testSimulation. Before doing anything go to load and load in camProc/scenes/NAMO_scene.urdf or some other scene you'd like to look at. 
3. Then, click on the right most tab and press the Start Connection button. Move the cursor in the window and you will see the cameras have moved.
4. Then, click the Query periodically button to get the current locations of the objects. You will have to move the cursor inside the window to see the update.
5. You can look at the actual values if you go to the tab to the visualization tab and clicking on one of the objects to get the location.
